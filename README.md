## Introduction
This repository documents what I learned in each class related to Linux command-line tools and Git version control, as part of my coursework. It contains the codes I learned in the classes. the purpose is to document it for future reference. This respository contains basic and  beginnner stuffs about linux and git to get started as bioinformatics or anyone who is interested in this.

## Class 1: Linux Basics
What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system widely used for development and servers. 

How is it useful for bioinformatics?
Bioinformatics involves the analysis of large-scale sequencing data, often in gigabytes or terabytes. Linux is the preferred operating system for bioinformatics because it efficiently handles large datasets and provides powerful command-line tools for data preprocessing and downstream analysis. Many bioinformatics software tools and pipelines are developed for Linux, making it essential for managing, processing, and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.

In this class i learned about the fundamentals of Linux command line.

###Topics covered
#### 1. Navigating the File System
Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure. Learning how to move through directories is crucial when working with large projects and datasets.

- `pwd` – Displays the current working directory  
- `cd` – Changes the directory  
- `/` – Represents the root directory and is used as a path separator  

Example:
```bash
cd /home/user/project
pwd
